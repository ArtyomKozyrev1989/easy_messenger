# easy_messenger
This is easy toy console messenger for two sides, one side is a server by default, another is a client which connects to the server to start chat. Modules socket, thread were heavily used to create the program. 

To use the program, copy all .py files to one folder and then start server.py and client.py in any order you wish (all bugs were caught I hope).

As usual feel free to use the code. I'll be happy if somebody learn from the project.

If you have any questions send me email kozirev8@gmail.com .
